  <h1> Tannor Wallace is going to rock this mic!</h1>
  <hr>
  <p><b>My</b> name is Tannor Wallace, and I have been working at jobs that I dislike for too long, and life (or "the
    universe" if you're like my wife) told me that it was time to take a leap. I convinced my employer to lay me off
    when budget cuts came so i would be able to attend Boise Code Works.
  </p>
  <p><b>I</b>took my time in researching Boise Code Works before I commited to signing up and could not find a bad thing
    about
    this program. So I took that leap and here I am. I want a job that I can be proud of and a career, that if asked I
    can say "look at what I doooo "www.i built this.com"
  </p>
  <p><b>So</b> here I am looking forward to learning the skills to be sucessfull in a career I have been interested in
    since I
    was a child. Originally inspired by the cheesey movie Hackers 1996.</p>
  <hr>
  <p><b>What</b> I would love to gain from my time at Boise Code Works.
    <ol>
      <li>Near mastery of JavaScript!</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I would love to over come my feeling of being intimidated by adavanced JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Learn the back end of the development process.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I have very little knowledge of what happens on the server side of web development. This is a blind spot
          that I would like to correct.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>A firm foundation of the tools, softskills, industry terms, and competencey to be sucessfull in software
        development. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>knowledge is power.</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
